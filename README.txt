TO COMPILE:

ant -buildfile build.xml all

NOTE: Please put the Input file where the source file is there in directory.

TO RUN:
Please go to the directory where build.xml is present and run 

ant -buildfile build.xml run -Darg0=input.txt -Darg1=output.txt -Darg2=3 -Darg3=4 

To CLEAN:
ant clean
 
TO UN-TAR:
tar xvzf sumanth_chadalla_assign2.tar.gz

Data Structure Used:
***************************************************
I am using ArrayList Data Structure.
I am using this beccause add and retrieve takes only O(1) time to execute. 
And is very easy to handle and use.

Time Complexity is 0(n).
